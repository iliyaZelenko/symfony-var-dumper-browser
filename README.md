This package can be easily used in your Symfony projects.

It allows you to debug through [Symfony VarDumper server](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-4-1-vardumper-server) (`bin/console dump:server`), 
providing a convenient and beautiful information output in the **browser** and **without reloading** the page.

Thus, you use the `dump()` function in your code, anywhere, for example, when do you request to **REST API**, 
or in the **console command** and all the information will be displayed in your **browser** in **live mode**.

Features:
- the display is nicely tuned through CSS, the animation of a new messages
- you can open / close levels (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Left Click</kbd> opens all lower levels)
- output time in current time zone format and locale (If you are an Arab, then the date will be of this kind: "٢٠‏/١٢‏/٢٠١٢")
- search by individual messages with convenient display
- clearing the page from messages
- you can select the background color (the selection is saved)
- you can change the width of the container (the selection is saved)

I can add a lot more, write sentences!

## Installation

<small>It is assumed that in the root of your project there is a file `package.json`.</small>

```bash
npm install --save-dev symfony-var-dumper-browser
# Or if you're using Yarn
yarn add --dev symfony-var-dumper-browser
```

## Using

You need to start two servers (`server:dump` and server of this package), 
fortunately this can be done with one command:

```bash
npx server:dump-browser --run-dump
# Or if you're using Yarn
yarn server:dump-browser --run-dump
```

There is a second way:

You can run the `server:dump` manually:

```bash
php ./bin/console server:dump --format=html > dump.html
```
 
and then simply run the package without the `--run-dump` argument.

## --help

The following options are available:

```
Options:
  -v, --version      output the version number
      --host [host]  server host (default: "127.0.0.1")
  -p, --port [port]  server port (default: 9000)
  -b, --path [path]  path to file generated by Symfony's "server:dump" command.
(default: "dump.html")
  -r, --run-dump     manually runs Symfony's "server:dump" command (uses dump.ht
ml).
  --no-open          it won't open your browser.
  -h, --help         output usage information
```

## How it works

Command `server:dump-browser --run-dump` starts the [Symfony VarDumper server](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-4-1-vardumper-server) (`bin/console dump:server`),
and another server on the Node.js which you can open in the browser,
this package (CLI process) is watching the file changes (dump.html) which makes a symphony server.
When the html file is changed through the symphony (and added new messages to this file),
a signal is sent to the browser through [sockets](socket.io) and the browser displays these messages on the page.

## TODO

- tests
- checkbox indicating whether the information is initially open (I'm talking about where you can manually open / close it.)
- icon for the page
- different output style
- time in the style of "5 seconds ago", "2 minutes ago"
